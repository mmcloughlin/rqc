**Redis query compiler** (rqc) generates lua scripts to execute queries on
redis sets.

There are a few similar projects out there and I learned a lot from digging
around in their source code:

* [Zoom](https://github.com/albrow/zoom) is an awesome library that offers
  similar funtionality at a higher level

* [django redis engine](https://github.com/MirkoRossini/django-redis-engine)
  also contains very similar ideas
